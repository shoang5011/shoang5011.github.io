  excerpt: "Machine Learning, Data Science"

---

Back when I just decided to teach myself data science, I read a lot of blogs, GitHub, and people's personal websites, and learned a ton from them. The reason is that not only I was able to learn new concepts, but also saw the growth of one's expertise in data science. This enabled me to see the progress of how one could strategically acquire knowledge in this field, and eventually helped me in making better study plan.
That's why I decided to create this blog so I could both keep track of my journey, and potentially help others by sharing what I know.
A few things I will address in this blog:
* Machine Learning Projects
* Probability, Statistics, Linear Algebra and other math topics
* Python and R
* Database tools: SQL, Spark
* Job search experience
I will also blog about deep learning, neural nets once I have solid understanding, which is also my goal before the end of this year 2019.
As of now, I will start to organize first few projects, and will post them in chronological order.
