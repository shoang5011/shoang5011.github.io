# Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning
In this post, I will go over how I analyze and build a model using Titanic data set. This was the very first data science project that I actually built a predictive model using different algorithms, presented by the steps below.
## Data
The data is from a Kaggle competition called [*Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster*](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)?
Dataset consists of train and test data, of which both contain information about Titanic passengers, including ticket class, sex, age, cabin number, etc. For train data, it also has a field called "survival", representing if the passenger survived or not. Train data has 891 rows, while test data has 418 rows.
### Data Description
Survival: 0 = No, 1 = Yes
pclass (ticket class): 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
sex: Sex
Age: Age in years
sibsp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
parch: Number parents/children aboard
ticket: Ticket number
fare: Passenger fare
cabin: Cabin number
embarked: Port of Embarkation, C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
