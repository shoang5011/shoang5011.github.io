# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This is one of the projects I competed on Kaggle against 4,300 teams, and ended up being in top 4% on leader board. By taking part in this, I learned how to use stacking techniques, which is, to combine different machine learning models to increase predictive power of the final model.

## Data
The data is from a Kaggle competition called [*House Prices: Advance Regression Techniques*](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).
As usual, data consists of train and test data, where train data is used to train models, and then predict using test data for submission. Data has 80 features and about 2,000 samples.

## EDA
Train data is visualized by several methods for easier analysis. Visualization is one of the most effective way to explore and understand a data set. Therefore, in this post, I will also cover different types of graphs that can be used in different cases.
First, I will analyze dependent variable, which is SalePrice, using histogram plot to show distribution.

Then, I use scatter plot and box plot to analyze other independent variables.

* Note: For more visualization techniques for bivariate and multi-variate analysis, I recommend checking out Titanic project for further explanation and code snippet.

Missing data is a very serious problem in this project, since some of the features lack almost 100% info. For this specific project, missing values can be replaced by either None or 0 (it is not technically "missing values", as it is not available due to being 0 or does not have any).

EDA is the very first step to get to know of data, and decide what analyses are necessary for later data engineering and  model building.

## Data Engineering
In this step, some new features that are created from available features. For example, I create TotalSF column, which is the sum of TotalBsmtSF (total basement square footage), 1stFlrSF (first floor square footage) and 2ndFlSF (second floor square footage). These 3 latter columns are provided in the data set. By creating TotalSF column, the final model will have more power in prediction.

## Outliers
To deal with outliers, I usually choose to build a quick model, and determine if a point is outlier or not by calculating a score that follow the equation:
$$z = (residual - mean_residual) / std$$
For this project, I build a model using Ridge, and then remove outliers based on calculated score. This method eventually improves the final score.
