I am a master student at Case Western Reserve University, located in Cleveland, Ohio. I am an data scientist who could bring unique mindset and solution to challenges by using advanced statistical methods and machine learning.

I had exposure to data science field back when I was working in a lab during my undergraduate, developing a machine learning algorithm. Since then, I have focused on Math (statistics, probability, linear algebra), programming (Python and R), and other recent technologies.

About myself, I love to play soccer and basketball in my free time. I also enjoy outdoor activities and sightseeing. I plan to drive around the States in a loop fashion, and have so far finished most of it (I have covered Seattle to California to Georgia and up to New York).
