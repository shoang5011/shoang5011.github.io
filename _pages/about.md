I am an data scientist who could bring unique mindset and solution to challenges by using advanced statistical methods and machine learning. I have experience building end-to-end solutions that automate business' operations and drive the performance of the team/company. I am also pursuing Master's Degree from Georgia Institute of Technology, major in Computer Science, to further improve my programming skills, and solidify my knowledge in machine learning and deep learning domain.

I had first exposure to data science field back when I was working in a lab during my undergraduate, developing a machine learning algorithm. Since then, I have focused on Math (statistics, probability, linear algebra), programming (Python, R, C++), and other recent technologies including AWS, Docker, Spark.

I love to play soccer and basketball in my free time. I also enjoy outdoor activities and sightseeing. I have made several road trips that went around the US. I look forward to finishing the last trip from Seattle to New York soon, as Yellowstone is still on my bucket list.
