I am an data scientist who could bring unique mindset and solution to challenges by using advanced statistical methods and machine learning.

I had first exposure to data science field back when I was working in a lab during my undergraduate, developing a machine learning algorithm. Since then, I have focused on Math (statistics, probability, linear algebra), programming (Python and R), and other recent technologies.

About myself, I love to play soccer and basketball in my free time. I also enjoy outdoor activities and sightseeing. I have made several road trips that went around the US. I look forward to finishing the last trip from Seattle to New York soon, as Yellowstone is still on my bucket list.
